# TicTacToe

Select how big you want the game board to be. Ranges from 2x2-6x6 size. (REPLACED WITH DIFFICULTY TO PREPARE FOR AI OPPONENT UPDATE)

The paint function was my favorite thing to learn about during this project, especially when using it to create a custom game board and layout.

As a user, you should be able to start a new tic tac toe game.
As a user, you should be able to click on a square to add X first and then O, and so on.
As a user, you should be shown a message based on the winner, or if there is a draw.
As a user, you should not be able to click the same square twice
As a user, you should be shown a message when a player wins or there is a or tie
As a user, you should not be able to continue playing after the game has concluded
As a user, you should be able to play the game again without refreshing the page

Unsolved Problems:

When rewriting the Javascript for AI and by using the prototype function, I have tripped an error in Chrome that nullifies the placeholder element and won't allow the table to render. Oddly enough, it works in CodePen. Will Revisit to fix for later versions.
