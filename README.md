As a user, I should be able to play the game again without refreshing the page.



[Planning:]
I got quite lost in the planning and studying of documentation throughout this project. I found myself thinking more about how I would do things, 
instead of actually trying to execute. This included many style choices, but it came down to making sure the MVP was at least functional.


[Unsolved Problems:]
-Animated Background
